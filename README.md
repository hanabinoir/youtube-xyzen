# YouTube XYZen

A Customized YouTube App which blocks ads.

## Summary

With the initial commit, the app basically works on Pixel 4 emulator and my Pixel 3a device, 
but there are some runtime bugs and some error with the project.

The iOS app is not tested yet.

Please check about the issues for specific problem, 
and please do not hesitate to give any suggestions or improvement to this app.
